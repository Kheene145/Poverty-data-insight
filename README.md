## Project Overview
- This project analyzes global and regional trends in extreme poverty between 1985â€“2018, with a special case study on Nigeria.
- By combining poverty share data with GDP per capita, the analysis explores whether economic growth translates into broad-based poverty reduction and improved living standards.

## Data Source

- Poverty Dataset:

- Columns: Country, Year, Share of Population in Poverty (% of population in extreme poverty)

- Source: World Bank, Our World in Data

- GDP Dataset (Nigeria):

- Columns: Year, GDP_per_capita

- Derived variable: Daily Income ($) = GDP_per_capita Ã· 365

---


### Tools
Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization


## Data Cleaning Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following steps were carried out:

Cleaned missing values and ensured numeric formatting for key variables.

Standardized Year format for merging across datasets.

Created derived feature: Daily Income = GDP per capita Ã· 365.
---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key questions explored:

How has global poverty changed between 1985â€“2018?

Which regions reduced poverty fastest, and which lagged?

Which countries achieved the largest poverty reduction?

In Nigeria, does rising GDP per capita correspond to falling poverty share?

### Data Analysis

The analysis involved:

Line Charts: Global and regional poverty share trends.

Multi-Line Comparison: Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Bar Plots: Top 10 countries with largest poverty reduction.

---


### Results/Findings

- Global: Poverty declined from ~40% (1985) to ~10% (2018), showing major progress.

#### Regional:

- East Asia (e.g., China, Vietnam) achieved the fastest poverty reduction.

- Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest poverty rates.

- Country-Level: Top 10 countries demonstrated significant reductions, led by East Asian economies.

#### Nigeria Case Study:

- Average daily income ~ $2.7/day, yet millions live on <$2/day.

- Revealed mismatch between GDP growth and poverty reduction.

- Key drivers: inequality, reliance on averages, informal economy, and differences in PPP-based poverty measures.

---


### Recommendations

- Policy Focus: Pair GDP growth with redistributive policies to ensure benefits reach low-income households.

- Targeted Programs: Increase investment in education, health, and rural development in Sub-Saharan Africa.

- Income Measures: Complement GDP with household surveys, PPP-adjusted data, and inequality indices for realistic poverty tracking.

- Nigeria: Implement poverty alleviation programs that directly target vulnerable populations, rather than relying solely on GDP growth.in Nigeria.

---


### Limitations

- Poverty dataset limited to broad indicators, lacking household-level detail.

- GDP per capita is an average and does not capture income inequality or wealth distribution.

- Informal economic activity and regional disparities may be underrepresented.

- No integration of qualitative data (e.g., employment, access to services, social protection).
